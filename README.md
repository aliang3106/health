# How to run
In order to run the program, the bayes.py which contains the Naive Bayesian Model functions should be run firstly. And then the test.py should be run to predict the scores and get an Excel with scores. In the test.py, the file path of train data, test data and results should be changed as needed. (11, 12, 80, 83 lines) 

val.py : Calculate the average accuracy using separated Naive Bayesian Model with cross validation.

normalbayesval.py : Calculate the average accuracy using Normal Bayesian Model with cross validation.

undiveded.py : Calculate the accuracy using Naive Bayesian Model for breakfast, lunch, dinner types together.

correlation.py : Show the correlation among each feature.
